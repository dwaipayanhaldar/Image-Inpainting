# Image Inpainting 🎨🧠

This repository contains the LaTeX code and report for my **final year seminar project** on **Image Inpainting**, submitted as part of the undergraduate curriculum at **Jadavpur University**.

## 📄 Overview

**Image Inpainting** is the process of reconstructing lost or deteriorated parts of an image using information from the surrounding areas. The goal is to fill in missing regions so that the image appears natural and visually plausible.

This project provides a comprehensive study of image inpainting techniques, covering both traditional approaches and modern deep learning-based methods.
